# Seismic detection with CNN

Only a fraction of seismic data on Planetary Seismology is useful and missons struggle
with the power requirements to send data back to Earth. With this in mind, we developed
an algorithm that is capable to discern when start and when to stop the recordings.

# Fourier View

At the "Fourier View", a class named "fourier_and_heatmap.py" was created in order to simplify the viewing of the file data in the Fourier space. With this class you can properly calculate the FFT and plot it graphs and the heatmaps (in 2d and 3d). An example of how to do it is presented at the "using_fourier.py" file.

The "Tests" folder contains the first files that motivated this analysis. Because of it we could determine that the Frequency of 1Hz was a good parameter for denoising (such as filtering).
